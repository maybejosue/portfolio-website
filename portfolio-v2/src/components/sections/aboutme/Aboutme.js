              Hey, my name is Josue Rodriguez and my professional career started
              when I dropped out of college to attend Lambda School, a coding
              boot camp for Full Stack Web Development, iOS Development, and
              Data Science.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over the past year, Iâ€™ve studied intensively on a remote team
              building real products with other software engineers, sharpening
              my skills to understand, plan, execute, reflect but most
              importantly think like a Developer -- producing creative ideas and
              solutions to solve programming problems.
              <br />
              <br />
              As for myself, I've been selling vintage and brand-name men's
              clothing, hard-to-find sneakers and accessories as a side hustle /
              hobby and it's grown into a passion for fashion overall. I also
              enjoy watching anime, reading manga, and one day hope to visit
              Japan with my brother.
              <br />
              <br />
              All in all, my mission is to excel in everything I put my mind
              too!

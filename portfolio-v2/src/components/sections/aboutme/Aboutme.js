                Hey, my name is Josue Rodriguez and my professional career
                started when I dropped out of college to attend{" "}
                <span href="https://lambdaschool.com/about">Lambda School</span>
                , a coding boot camp for Full Stack Web Development and Data
                Science.
                <br />
                <br />
                Over the past year, Iâ€™ve studied intensively on a remote team
                building real products with other engineers, sharpening my
                skills to understand, plan, execute, reflect but most
                importantly think like a Developer -- producing creative ideas
                and solutions to solve programming problems.
                <br />
                <br />
                As for myself, I've been selling vintage and brand-name men's
                clothing, hard-to-find sneakers, and accessories as a side
                hustle / hobby for a couple of years now. I also enjoy watching
                anime, reading manga, and one day hope to visit Japan with my
                older brother. Ultimately, however, I would love to join a
                friendly developer team to consider a second family.
                <br />
                <br />
                All in all, my mission is to excel in everything I put my mind
                too!
